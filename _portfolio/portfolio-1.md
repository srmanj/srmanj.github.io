- 💬 Quotes
    - “The one who plants trees, knowing that he will never sit in their shade, has at least started to understand the meaning of life.”— Rabindranath Tagore
    - "Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else." — Margaret Mead
    - "True gold fears no fire"; *a person of integrity can stand severe tests*  — **(谚语 proverb)
    - "Discipline yourself, and others won't need to." — John Wooden
    - The Man In The Arena

        “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” – Theodore Roosevelt, the Man in the Arena. Delivered at the Sorbonne (Paris) on April 23rd, 1910.
